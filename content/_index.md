Hi, I'm Hugo, I'm Galician and this is my website.

I work at [CERN](cern.ch) as a Software Engineer in the Storage group
where I'm proud of working in a bunch of exciting projects like 
[CERNBox](https://cernbox.web.cern.ch) and [EOS](https://eos.web.cern.ch).

Previously I've worked at the Universty of Vigo in various research projects,
being the most notable [ClawIO](https://github.com/clawio).

I like to dive and travel and this website is a mix of professional records and personal interests.
