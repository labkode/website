Microservices are an approach to distributed systems that promote the use of finely grained services with their own lifecycles, which collaborate. The use of microservices facilitates embracing new technologies and architectural patterns. Sync and share providers could increase the modularity and facilitating the exchange of components and best practices adopting the use of microservices.
In CERNBox we have currently started replacing functionality in the monolithic software with small microservices to improve the management of the service and ease the integration with other services. We report on the current architecture and on the future evolution of the platform based on microservices.
