ownCloud offers a great platform for developing applications that can integrate a variety of services, from document editing apps to image previews and more. After running the CERNBox service for the last 5 years, an ownCloud based cloud sync and share for CERN, we have identified that as more integrations are done in the ownCloud platform more knowledge is needed by the ownCloud operators to manage the platform. In CERNBox, we have introduced a distributed approach to split team responsibilities when developing service integrations.
