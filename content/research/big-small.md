Jakub Moscicki’s update on CERNbox provided us with the analysis of the interesting use-case. The systems that already exist at CERN are supposed to still store massive volumes of data (10s PBs), while robust and effective synchronisation will be possible for selected data sets, e.g. the directory with the computations output data. Jakub also and shared the service usage statistics: 700 users, 3TBs of space used by 6M of files. Feedback from users is very positive, according to Jakub, including ownCloud look and feel and performance observed.
